## 3.1 Hardware Backend Interfaces

### QHAL — Quantum Hardware Abstraction Layer
- **Citation**: Multi-level quantum/classical interface specifications
- **What it is**: A multi-level abstraction model for interoperability between low-level control/hardware and higher-level software stacks. Treats the quantum/classical boundary as a designed interface, not an ad hoc SDK layer.
- **Why it matters**: Directly supports `HardwareDeviceInterface`, `HardwareCapabilities`, and topology mapping. Capabilities should be discoverable and negotiated at multiple levels (logical gates ↔ timing/pulses ↔ hardware constraints).
- **Rust implication**: Define a layered capability model:
  ```rust
  pub struct DeviceCapabilities {
      pub gate_level_profile: GateLevelProfile,
      pub timing_profile: Option<TimingProfile>,
      pub pulse_profile: Option<PulseProfile>,
  }
  ```
  Allow adapters to implement only the levels they support.

### QIR Specification (QIR Alliance)
- **Citation**: https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-spec
- **What it is**: LLVM-based quantum intermediate representation with profiles (base vs adaptive) for hardware capability boundaries.
- **Why it matters**: Cleanest "portable contract" for hardware abstraction. Aligns with Azure Quantum and cross-platform efforts.
- **Rust implication**: `QuantumDeviceInterface` should accept either:
  - LogosQ IR (native)
  - QIR-compatible lowered form
  
  Use profiles to drive `HardwareCapabilities` negotiation.

### QIR Execution Engine (QIR-EE)
- **Citation**: https://github.com/qir-alliance/qir-runner
- **What it is**: Runtime that parses/interprets QIR and dispatches to multiple hardware platforms and simulators; includes extension points for custom runtime/hardware environments.
- **Why it matters**: Reference architecture for `ConnectionManager`, job dispatch, and mixed classical/quantum instruction handling.
- **Rust implication**: Model execution core as:
  ```
  job → lowered_ir → dispatch → measurement_stream
  ```
  With explicit extension points for provider adapters.

### OpenQASM 3
- **Citation**: arXiv:2104.14722 — "OpenQASM 3: A broader and deeper quantum assembly language"
- **What it is**: Machine-independent quantum assembly language extended to cover real-time classical control flow, timing, and near-hardware specificity (including calibration/characterization use cases).
- **Why it matters**: Validates "Quantum OS" runtime view: quantum programs aren't only static circuits; they include timing + measurement-driven control.
- **Rust implication**: IR needs explicit support for:
  - Measurement events
  - Conditional branching (restricted form)
  - Timing/scheduling metadata

## 3.2 Cloud Provider Integrations

### IBM Quantum (Qiskit Runtime)
- **Citation**: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/runtime
- **What it is**: REST auth model + runtime job endpoints; backend classes and property models (calibration snapshots, gate/qubit properties).
- **Why it matters**: Ground truth for authentication, job lifecycle, and calibration retrieval/time series.
- **Rust implication**: Build provider-agnostic `CredentialProvider` + `JobClient`, then implement IBM as one adapter with typed parsing for backend properties:
  ```rust
  pub trait CloudProviderAdapter {
      fn authenticate(&self, credentials: &Credentials) -> Result<Session>;
      fn submit_job(&self, session: &Session, circuit: &CompiledCircuit) -> Result<JobId>;
      fn poll_status(&self, session: &Session, job_id: JobId) -> Result<JobStatus>;
      fn fetch_results(&self, session: &Session, job_id: JobId) -> Result<ExecutionResult>;
  }
  ```

### Amazon Braket
- **Citation**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/APIReference/
- **What it is**: API endpoints like `CreateQuantumTask` and developer guide patterns for submission/monitoring via API and SDK.
- **Why it matters**: Defines "lowest-level" cloud contract: create task, poll status, fetch results, handle S3 outputs.
- **Rust implication**: Treat Braket as a clean REST adapter; keep device discovery separate from job submission.

### Azure Quantum
- **Citation**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/
- **What it is**: Official guidance for submitting QIR-formatted circuits and other formats to Azure Quantum, including provider targets and constraints.
- **Why it matters**: Reinforces QIR as practical interoperability backbone (especially for targets with profile constraints).
- **Rust implication**: If QIR export is supported, Azure becomes "just another adapter," not a special case.

### IonQ Direct API
- **Citation**: https://docs.ionq.com/api-reference/v0.3/
- **What it is**: Direct API submission docs + endpoint references and OpenAPI schema.
- **Why it matters**: Great for building stable Rust client with codegen against OpenAPI.
- **Rust implication**: Generate client bindings from OpenAPI, then wrap in unified `ConnectionManager` and `HardwareDeviceInterface`.

### Rigetti QCS
- **Citation**: https://docs.rigetti.com/qcs/
- **What it is**: Official QCS HTTP API docs + Quil/Quil-T docs; explicitly states programs are assembled using current calibrations, with override mechanisms.
- **Why it matters**: Directly supports calibration-aware compilation and native gate/pulse lowering strategy.
- **Rust implication**: Keep clean separation between `logical_program` and `assembled_program`, with calibration snapshots as input to assembly:
  ```rust
  pub fn assemble(
      logical: &LogicalProgram,
      calibration: &CalibrationSnapshot,
      device: &DeviceTopology,
  ) -> Result<AssembledProgram>
  ```

## 3.3 Noise Model Framework

### Qiskit Aer Noise Model Construction
- **Citation**: https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.noise.NoiseModel.html
- **What it is**: Concrete examples and APIs for building noise models from Kraus/SuperOp representations, composing readout errors, and assembling full-device noise models.
- **Why it matters**: Most implementation-ready reference for `NoiseModel` trait + composable channels (depolarizing, damping, dephasing, readout).
- **Rust implication**: Represent noise as composable channels:
  ```rust
  pub trait NoiseChannel: Send + Sync {
      fn kraus_operators(&self) -> Vec<KrausOperator>;
      fn compose(&self, other: &dyn NoiseChannel) -> Box<dyn NoiseChannel>;
      fn tensor(&self, other: &dyn NoiseChannel) -> Box<dyn NoiseChannel>;
  }
  ```

### Crosstalk / Correlated Noise
- **Citation**: arXiv:2005.10921 — PEC practical work emphasizing crosstalk during parallel gates
- **What it is**: Demonstrates difficulty of representing noise on full devices due to crosstalk during parallel gates, motivating explicit correlated-noise modeling.
- **Why it matters**: Justifies "crosstalk noise model for multi-qubit gates" as not optional for realism.
- **Rust implication**: Include correlated-noise hooks:
  ```rust
  fn channel_for_parallel_gate_set(&self, gates: &[GateInstance]) -> Box<dyn NoiseChannel>;
  fn conditional_channel(&self, context: &ExecutionContext) -> Box<dyn NoiseChannel>;
  ```

## 3.4 Calibration System

### IBM Backend Properties
- **Citation**: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV2
- **What it is**: Backend properties and interfaces expose calibrated values over time (qubits, gates, last update timestamp).
- **Why it matters**: Canonical model for `CalibrationFetcher`, time series tracking, and qubit quality scoring.
- **Rust implication**: Store calibration as immutable snapshots:
  ```rust
  pub struct CalibrationSnapshot {
      pub device_id: DeviceId,
      pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
      pub qubit_properties: Vec<QubitCalibration>,
      pub gate_properties: Vec<GateCalibration>,
      pub readout_errors: Vec<ReadoutError>,
  }
  
  impl CalibrationSnapshot {
      pub fn qubit_quality_score(&self, qubit: usize) -> f64;
      pub fn select_best_qubits(&self, count: usize) -> Vec<usize>;
  }
  ```

### Rigetti Calibration-Aware Assembly
- **Citation**: https://docs.rigetti.com/qcs/guides/quil-t
- **What it is**: Rigetti's docs explicitly describe compilation/assembly using current calibrations and support calibration overrides.
- **Why it matters**: Supports "calibration-aware circuit compilation" and JSON format parsing strategy (provider-specific schemas).
- **Rust implication**: Calibration must be first-class input to compilation passes (routing/scheduling/echo pulses).

  }
  ```

      fn mitigate(&self, counts: &Counts, regularization: f64) -> Counts;
  }
  ```
